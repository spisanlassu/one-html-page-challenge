Aid4mail Portable comes in three editions: Converter, Investigator, and Enterprise. Each edition has different features and capabilities to suit your needs. Whether you need to migrate email accounts, process email data for litigation purposes, or recover deleted or corrupted emails, Aid4mail Portable can help you achieve your goals quickly and reliably.
 
Aid4mail Portable supports more than 30 email clients and mailbox formats, such as Office Outlook, Windows Live Mail, Thunderbird, and Eudora[^2^]. It can also access Gmail and Outlook 365 through their native APIs, which is more secure and efficient than IMAP[^1^]. You can convert between formats or transfer messages in the same format, for example from PST to PST. You can also export emails as searchable PDF files with linked attachments, or as HTML files that can be viewed in a browser.
 
Aid4mail Portable also offers powerful search and filtering options that let you find and select the emails you need. You can use the same syntax as Gmail and Microsoft 365 to create complex queries based on keywords, dates, senders, recipients, attachments, and more[^2^]. You can also use native pre-acquisition filters for Gmail, Outlook, and IMAP to reduce the amount of data you download[^2^]. Additionally, you can use Python scripting to customize your email processing tasks[^2^].
 
Aid4mail Portable is not only fast and accurate, but also reliable and secure. It has a robust IMAP client with error correction that can handle large IMAP accounts without losing data[^1^]. It also has forensic features that enable you to recover deleted and hidden emails, and process corrupt or unknown mail formats[^2^]. Furthermore, it allows you to grant temporary access to custodian accounts without providing login credentials[^1^].
