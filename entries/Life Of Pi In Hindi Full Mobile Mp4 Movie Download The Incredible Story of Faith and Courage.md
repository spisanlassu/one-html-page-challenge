Life of Pi is a novel by Yann Martel, published in 2001. It tells the story of Piscine Molitor Patel, or Pi, a 16-year-old boy from Pondicherry, India, who loves animals and religion. His family owns a zoo, but decides to move to Canada and sell the animals to other zoos. They board a Japanese cargo ship with some of the animals, but the ship sinks in a storm in the Pacific Ocean. Pi is the only human survivor, and he finds himself on a lifeboat with a zebra, an orangutan, a hyena, and a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. The novel follows Pi's journey of survival, faith, and discovery as he tries to coexist with the tiger and reach land.
