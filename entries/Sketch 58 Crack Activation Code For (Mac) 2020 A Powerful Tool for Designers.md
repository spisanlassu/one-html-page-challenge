## How to use Smart Layout in Sketch 58
 
Smart Layout is a new feature in Sketch 58 that lets you create responsive layouts for your designs with ease. Smart Layout allows you to set rules for how your layers and groups should resize and reposition when their content or parent changes. This way, you can create flexible components that adapt to different screen sizes and scenarios.
 
To use Smart Layout, you need to select a group or a symbol and enable Smart Layout in the inspector. You can then choose one of the four directions for how your group or symbol should resize: left to right, right to left, top to bottom, or bottom to top. You can also set custom spacing values for each edge of your group or symbol.
 
Once you have enabled Smart Layout for your group or symbol, you can see how it behaves when you change its content or parent. For example, if you have a button with text and an icon inside a group with Smart Layout enabled, you can see how the button adjusts its size and position when you change the text or the icon. You can also see how the group adjusts its size and position when you change its parent container.
 
Smart Layout works well with symbols, which are reusable components that you can create and edit in Sketch. Symbols allow you to maintain consistency across your designs and make changes quickly and easily. You can create symbols from any layer or group by clicking on the Create Symbol button in the toolbar or by choosing Create Symbol from the Layer menu. You can then edit your symbols in the Symbols page, which is a special page in your document where all your symbols are stored.
 
When you use symbols with Smart Layout enabled, you can create dynamic components that adapt to different content and contexts. For example, you can create a symbol for a card component that contains an image, a title, a subtitle, and a button. You can then enable Smart Layout for the card symbol and set rules for how it should resize and reposition its elements. You can then insert instances of the card symbol in your designs and override their content as needed. You can see how the card symbol adjusts its size and position according to its content and parent container.
 
## Tips and tricks for using Sketch 58
 
Here are some tips and tricks that can help you use Sketch 58 more efficiently and productively:
 
- Use keyboard shortcuts to access tools and commands quickly. You can find a list of keyboard shortcuts in the Help menu or by pressing â/ on your keyboard.
- Use plugins to extend the functionality of Sketch 58. Plugins are third-party extensions that add new features or enhance existing ones in Sketch 58. You can find and install plugins from the Plugins menu or from the Sketch website.
- Use libraries to share symbols, text styles, color variables, and layer styles across documents and teams. Libraries are external Sketch files that contain reusable assets that you can link to your documents. You can create libraries from any Sketch file by choosing Add as Library from the File menu. You can then manage your libraries from the Preferences window or from the Libraries tab in the inspector. 8cf37b1e13
